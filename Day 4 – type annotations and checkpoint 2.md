Day 4 wrapped up data types with annotation, how a programmer can dictate the exact data type of each variable and constants within Swift.
After this, Paul provided a high-level summary of what we had covered since the last checkpoint.
For checkpoint 2, I wrote some code that would take an array of strings and print the number of items and the number of unique items within the array.

To accomplish this, I created a standard array of albums. Then I made a set based on that array to give me the unique albums since sets cannot contain duplicate values.
