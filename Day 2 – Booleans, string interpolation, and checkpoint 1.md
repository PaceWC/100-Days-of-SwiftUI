Day 2 of the course covered the basics of Booleans, joining strings, and provided a recap of the basics of data.
Day 2 also held the first Checkpoint of the course. This Checkpoint aims to create a simple Celsius to Fahrenheit converter that outputs the values within a string.

It is nothing fancy, but it is a start and time spent on the keyboard. Looking forward to more Checkpoints.
