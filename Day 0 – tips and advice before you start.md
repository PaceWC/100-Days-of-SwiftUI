For Day 0, Paul provided some great advice on becoming an iOS Developer and offered many resources to assist in this journey.
<br>There were no coding exercises today, so I utilized my time to ensure my systems were ready to begin and reviewed how to use Github.
<br>I decided to use Github too:
<ol>
  <li>document this journey</li>
  <li>see how much progress I make within 100 days</li>
  <li>hopefully, inspire someone else to take up the 100-day challenge</li>
  <li>begin creating a public portfolio of all my work</li>
</ol>
