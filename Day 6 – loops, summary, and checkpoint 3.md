Day 6 covered loops within Swift and skip loop items by using the break and continue statements.<br>
The tricky part will be remembering the syntax for Swift and not trying to write it as I would in Python.<br>
A fitting Checkpoint for today's course, the classic "FizzBuzz" problem!<br>
For those unaware, FizzBuzz is basically:
<ol>
  <li>If it’s a multiple of 3, print “Fizz”</li>
  <li>If it's a multiple of 5, print "Buzz" </li>
  <li>If it's a multiple of 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" </li>
  <li>Otherwise, print the number.</li>
</ol>
