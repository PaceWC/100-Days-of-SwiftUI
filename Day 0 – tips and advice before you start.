Day 0: Before we begin.
For Day 0, Paul provided some great advice on becoming an iOS Developer and offered many resources to assist in this journey.
There were no coding exercises today, so I utilized my time to ensure my systems were ready to begin and reviewed how to use Github. I decided to use Github too:
document this journey
see how much progress I make within 100 days
hopefully, inspire someone else to take up the 100-day challenge
begin creating a public portfolio of all my work
